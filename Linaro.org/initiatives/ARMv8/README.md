# ARMv8

ARM announced its [64-bit ARMv8](http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/arm-discloses-technical-details-of-the-next-version-of-the-arm-architecture.php) architecture and associated ARM compiler and Fast Models in October 2011. As licensees have developed their ARMv8 solutions, Linaro has expanded its focus to include servers and networking and ARMv8 development work has become a major priority at Linaro, enabled by the ARM Fast Models and availability of silicon. Since 2011, ARM has announced a number of ARMv8 licensees and a majority of these are members of Linaro. In November 2015, the [ARMv8-M](http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/armv8-m-architecture-simplifies-security-for-smart-embedded-devices.php) architecture was announced and, in September 2016, Linaro announced the new [Linaro IoT and Embedded (LITE)](http://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-lite-collaborative-software-engineering-internet-things-iot/) group that has begun extending Linaro's work into the Cortex-M space.

When ARMv8 hardware began to appear in 2014, availability to software developers was limited by the types of systems available and their cost. To enable its own developers and the ecosystem to gain access to low-cost ARMv8 hardware suitable for software development, Linaro created the [96Boards](http://www.96Boards.org) specification in February 2015. This initiative has expanded to now include consumer, enterprise, IoT and TV platform specifications with mutliple boards and accessories available through third-party suppliers. A list of available hardware is included at the bottom of this page.

Linaro's focus is collaborative software development and working in the upstream to ensure good support for the latest ARM technology - ARMv8 is obviously a key part of that and Linaro, with its members, has enabled support in many upstream projects. An idea of the scale of this work can be gained from the [Linaro Patchwork](https://patches.linaro.org/) website. This website shows contributions across a wide range of projects, although it is not specific to ARMv8. Linaro also makes toolchains and software images for AArch64 (the 64-bit execution state of ARMv8) available to interested developers. These range from full access to the open source code for individual components up to complete Reference Platform tarballs. Basic access to these files is available through the [Downloads page](http://www.linaro.org/downloads/) on this website. Advanced developers who want to access individual components, snapshots of ongoing development work and historical files can visit the [Linaro releases website](http://releases.linaro.org/), but we would encourage everyone to begin with the Downloads page unless they are very familiar with how Linaro operates.

If you are looking to work on ARMv8-A, you can do so without any hardware in one of two ways: by using software models, also called virtual platforms, or by accessing someone else's hardware remotely. This approach has been used in many open source projects. Linaro provided downloads and [ARM’s Fast Models](http://www.arm.com/fastmodels) virtual platform enables you to boot a virtual ARMv8 system, run 64-bit binaries and start developing code for ARMv8.

In 2014 Linaro accelerated ARMv8 development by making significant use of the first two commercially available ARMv8 hardware development platforms: the ARM [Juno development platform](http://www.arm.com/products/tools/development-boards/versatile-express/juno-arm-development-platform.php) and the Applied Micro (APM) [X-C1 development kit](https://www.apm.com/products/data-center/x-gene-family/x-gene/). In 2015, accessibility to hardware is set to improve rapidly with a broader choice and range of hardware platforms available including:

- [AMD 64-bit ARM Opteron Developer Kit](http://www.amd.com/en-us/press-releases/Pages/64-bit-developer-kit-2014jul30.aspx)
- [Cavium Project Thunder](http://www.cavium.com/thundersdk_access_application.html)

To help commercial software developers who do not yet have access to ARMv8 hardware, Linaro has worked with AMD, Applied Micro and ARM to create an ARMv8 server cluster to provide virtual access to enterprise-class hardware. More information about this is available [here](http://www.linaro.org/leg/servercluster).

Downloads and more information
The OpenEmbedded Engineering Builds for ARM’s Virtual Platforms contain Boot Firmware and Linux Kernel images and a selection of Root filesystems. The most recent releases can be found here: https://releases.linaro.org/members/arm/platforms/latest/

We provide pre-built versions of Linaro GCC and Linaro GDB that target either a Linaro Engineering Build or a bare-metal target. The most recent releases can be found here: http://releases.linaro.org/latest/components/toolchain/binaries/
